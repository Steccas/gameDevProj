# gameDevProj

It's just a small unity 2D patform that I created for an University Project.

I named it JDI 2 and used some assets not made by me but taken from the community.

There are some scripts that you may find useful.

I DO NOT OWN ANY ASSET USED AND THE PROJECT HAS NOT ANY LUCRATIVE INTENTIONS IN IT
